# *Oluwaseyi Adelaju — Technical Product Manager (Identity, Security, Fraud Prevention)*

Hi, I’m **Oluwaseyi Adelaju**, a **Senior Technical Product Manager** specializing in:

* **Digital Identity & Secure Onboarding**
* **Identity Verification (IDV), Biometrics & Anti-Spoofing**
* **KYC/eKYC/AML Compliance**
* **Fraud Prevention & Identity Lifecycle Management**
* **API-driven platforms, SDKs & enterprise identity infrastructure**

I build identity and security products that operate at **national scale**, power **regulated industries**, and serve **millions of users** across Africa.

My experience spans telecom identity systems, national ID enrollment platforms, ML-based fraud detection, and high-throughput verification infrastructure for enterprise and government.

## 🚀 **About Me**

I’m a problem solver who loves sitting at the intersection of **Identity Engineering, Security Architecture, and Product Strategy**.

Over the past few years, I’ve:

* Delivered **8M+ identity activations** for a major African telecom using a BYOD identity onboarding system.
* Led AI-based **liveness and anti-spoofing development**, reducing fraud by **95%**.
* Scaled Android-based enrollment platforms used in **national ID programs**.
* Designed contactless biometric capture flows that reduced operational cost by **70%**.
* Built and optimized enterprise flows for SIM registration, API authentication, and identity verification.

I work best with engineers, data scientists, and security teams—translating identity and compliance requirements into clean technical specs, scalable systems, and measurable outcomes.
